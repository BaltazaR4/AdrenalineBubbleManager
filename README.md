# AdrenalineBubbleManager

![header](preview.jpg)

Create and organize your direct adrenaline bubbles.

### Description ###
This useful application allows you to make personalized bubbles with 'icon' and 'title' of your PSP content (HBS / PSX / ISO / CSO) quick and easy, using the 'LMAN' plugin, and adding the lines Of the plugin to the GAMEID in the config.txt of taihen, also creates the GAMEID.TXT for the plugin, forgetting completely of the tedious and long manual method.

### Instructions ###
The initial interface is composed by the list of available PSP content to launch, get positioned over the desired content using the D-pad and press X on the desired game to proceed to select the bubble that will launch it, a popup window will show you all the bubbles available to use, you only have to position yourself on the desired one and press X, to begin the linking process, this app will tell you if there is an installed pboot and if you want to change it and continue, then the app will ask you if the STARTDAT should be disabled, you will also be asked if you want to change the Name the bubble or use that of the content to link, and finally you will be asked to restart the console to update the database.
Note: This app will allow you to personalize more than one bubble at a time.

### MARCH33 driver ###
- Usage of M33 driver + EBOOT.OLD (prometheus) is recommended on following situations:
  1. For PSP content which go pass the startdat but stay in black screen. I'll mention PE 3rd birthday as an example.
  2. For all PSP minis.
- For PSP content which still won't go beyond the black screen you should contact Leecherman or wait for his next update.
